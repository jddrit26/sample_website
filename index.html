<!-- Here we’ve placed the .nav-menu rule above the .nav-spacing rule,  -->
<!-- but in this case the order doesn’t matter. (The order of CSS rules -->
<!-- often does matter, though; the details are covered in Learn Enough -->
<!-- CSS & Layout to Be Dangerous.) -->

<!-- As a final step, we’ll add the counterpart to a CSS class, called a CSS -->
<!-- 'identifier', or id (read as separate letters: 'eye-dee'). Adding an    -->
<!-- id is certainly not necessary, and nor is it considered a good practice -->
<!-- to use ids for styling (for reasons covered in Learn Enough CSS &       -->
<!-- Layout to Be Dangerous); we include it here mainly for purposes of      -->
<!-- illustration. But ids can be quite useful for deep linking (discussed   -->
<!-- in Section 4.7.3), and they are essential for many JavaScript           -->
<!-- applications (as covered in Learn Enough JavaScript Be Dangerous).      -->

<!-- In this case, we’ll call the id main-nav (to indicate the main              -->
<!-- navigational element) and add it to the main navigational div,              -->
<!-- as shown in Listing 4.21. This has no effect on the page’s appearance,      -->
<!-- but serves to illustrate the syntax. Note that, unlike classes, which       -->
<!-- can be used multiple times on a page, a given CSS id can be used only once. -->

    <div id="main-nav" class="nav-menu">

    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
      learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
      movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
      <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
      <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
      This page is part of the sample site for
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to
      Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of
      <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web.

    </p>

<!-- One of the simplest and most useful applications of CSS ids is for     -->
<!-- creating links to arbitrary HTML elements using a convenient hash      -->
<!-- symbol (#) syntax. By adding the id founders to the 'Founders' h2      -->
<!-- tag, show that you can visit that section of the page directly by      -->
<!-- pasting the URL sample_website/index.html#founders into your browser’s -->
<!-- address bar.                                                           -->
    <h2 id="founders">Founders</h2>

    <p>
      <em><b>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</em></b> was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      <b>at least a billion people</b>, and probably more.
